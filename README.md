## Quicktext: Text from CLI ðŸ“¨

Silly tool to send a quick text from CLI!



### Ideas to do:
- HANDLE SPLITTING ROUTING
- See if we can pull group chat names from messages
- Maybe separate files of group aliases v. person aliasing. at least code not storage.
- AppleScript to detect when you receive a message from a user and read it in, can then automate responding
- Make a schedule send utility
    - Handle storing messages and time to send
    - Make a constantly running background process
    - Have this process run at startup, could be in zsh startup
- Command to send ascii art that fit to phone or laptop
- attachments and pre-loaded ones might be cool
